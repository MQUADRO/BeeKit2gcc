#BeeKit2gcc

This is a makefile and some scripts to help in porting a project generated by Freescale BeeKit to GCC.

##Requirements
  * A bare metal ARM compiler (like arm-none-eabi-gcc)
  * librt.a from CodeWarrior

## Steps
1. Export the BeeKit project. Be sure to select **CodeWarrior** as external IDE.
2. Download or clone this repository in the root directory of the project (the one containing makefile.init).
3. **You may skip this step if you're on a case-insensitive filesystem** Unfortunately the source code generated by BeeKit has a lot of case mismatches. You can run the `fixnames.sh` script to fix them semi-automatically..
4. Find the correct librt.a in CodeWarrior resource directories and copy it in the project root.
5. `cd` in the project's root directory and run `make -f BeeKit2gcc/Makefile`.
6. If the build completes successfully, you'll see `main.elf` and `main.srec`.
